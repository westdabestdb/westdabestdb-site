Things are crazy. Honestly, it's hard for me to keep my focus these days. Too much going on. I've got my full-time job, two side projects, one side gig, and I'm still trying to figure out how to maintain my focus and not get burned out.

Sometimes I feel like I do too much and it's time to take a break, but I also enjoy keeping my mind occupied with all of those things.

I'm going to take a break from my job, side projects, side gig, go for a vacation for at least two weeks, and try to figure out how to maintain my focus and not get burned out.

Now time to take a sip of my coffee and get back to grinding.
