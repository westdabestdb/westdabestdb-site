I guess this was inevitable. I've finally pulled the trigger to create my own blog. I've tried billion times before to come up with an easy and elegant solution but all the drafts went to the garbage. Somehow blogging gets too complicated when you want to add your touch with existing tools.

Anyway, let's meet. I'm GÃ¶rkem, aka westdabestdb on the internet, a 24 years old software developer.

In this blog I'll be sharing my experiences on creating different projects, products and mostly whining about how hard balancing full time work and side projects is.

Thanks for reading.
