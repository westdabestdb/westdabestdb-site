It's been a few months since I've really dedicated any time to my side projects or personal growth. I've been stuck in a rut of burnout and just feeling overwhelmed with everything going on in my life.

But recently, I've made the decision to get back on track and start improving myself both mentally and physically.

One of the first things I did was start working on my side projects again. I love being able to create and work on things that I'm passionate about, and it's been far too long since I've dedicated any time to them.

I've found that the more I work on these projects, the more energized and motivated I feel. It's a great way for me to take my mind off of my daily stressors and focus on something that brings me joy.

I've also started working out again. It's something that I used to enjoy, but over the past few months, I just haven't had the energy or motivation to do it. But I've noticed that when I do work out, I feel better both physically and mentally.

It's a great way to clear my head and get some much-needed endorphins. Plus, I'm starting to see some physical changes, which is always a bonus.

Overall, I feel like I'm starting to get back to my old self again. I'm more focused, motivated, and energized than I have been in a long time. It's not always easy to take the time to focus on myself, but I'm learning that it's crucial for my overall well-being.

If you're feeling burnt out or just not like yourself lately, I highly recommend taking some time to work on your personal growth and focus on things that bring you joy. It might just be the boost you need to get back on track.
