A Friend Was Tired of Checking Tesla Inventory, So I Built a Bot in One Day for TMCTR | Our Tesla Enthusiast Community.

As one of the admins of TMCTR, a thriving community of over 2,500 Tesla enthusiasts (and growing daily!), I’ve seen firsthand how passionate our members are about securing their dream Tesla. But there was one recurring problem—manually refreshing Tesla’s website multiple times a day just to check for new inventory.

One of our community members was tired of the process and vented their frustration:

"There has to be a better way."

I agreed. So, I built the solution—within just one day.

💡 Less than 24 hours later: We have a fully automated Tesla inventory tracking bot, live and running, built specifically for TMCTR and our growing community, eliminating the need for manual refreshes and ensuring real-time notifications for our members.

🛠 How I Built It in a Day:

To make the system scalable, fast, and efficient, I leveraged a serverless-first approach using Supabase and Telegram API.

- 🔹 Supabase PostgreSQL Database – A managed database solution to store Tesla inventory records efficiently.
- 🔹 Row-Level Security (RLS) – Enforcing access control policies, ensuring only admins can query or modify inventory data.
- 🔹 Supabase Cron Jobs – Every 5 minutes, a cron job triggers a function to fetch the latest Tesla inventory.
- 🔹 Supabase Edge Functions – Serverless functions execute API requests with minimal latency, processing and storing new inventory data in real time.
- 🔹 Telegram REST API – When a new inventory update is detected, a Telegram bot instantly notifies TMCTR members.

⚙️ Workflow Automation:

- 🔹 Polling → Every 5 minutes, a Supabase Cron Job calls an Edge Function to fetch Tesla’s latest inventory.
- 🔹 Data Processing → The function parses the response and detects new inventory changes.
- 🔹 Database Update → If new listings are found, they are stored in PostgreSQL, while Row-Level Security ensures restricted access.
- 🔹 Instant Alerts → A notification is pushed via Telegram API, instantly informing TMCTR members of the latest inventory updates.

📈 Why this matters:

This automation eliminates the tedious task of manually refreshing Tesla’s inventory pages, making the entire process seamless and real-time. With Supabase’s serverless architecture, the bot runs with low latency, high availability, and zero manual intervention—perfectly aligning with TMCTR’s growing Tesla community.

Building for TMCTR isn’t just about automation—it’s about creating meaningful solutions that make life easier for Tesla enthusiasts. This bot is just one example of how technology can enhance the Tesla ownership experience.
